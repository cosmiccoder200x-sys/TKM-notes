3. Must-memorize definitions in precise, exam-ready wording
4. Step-by-step worked examples for every numerical/derivation-based topic in that module
5. A formula sheet — every formula in the module, copy-friendly, with a one-line note on when to use each
6. The most frequently asked KTU exam question types for that module, ranked High/Medium/Low by how often they're likely asked, with a short note on how to structure the answer
7. A one-page "night before the exam" revision summary for that module

Don't skip any topic listed in the syllabus above. Keep explanations exam-focused, not textbook-length — I need to be able to answer a KTU Part A/Part B question well, not write a thesis. For numerical-heavy topics, prioritize a fully worked example over more prose. If a topic is genuinely conceptual/theory-only (no numericals), say so instead of forcing a fake example.`;
