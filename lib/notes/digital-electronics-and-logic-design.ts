        whyItMatters:
          "Number system conversions and signed-number arithmetic (especially 2's complement) are 'free marks' questions that come up almost every semester — they're mechanical and fast once practiced, so they're worth nailing down completely before anything else.",

        "Parity code (error detection): an extra parity bit is added so the total number of 1s is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity) — a single-bit transmission error is then detected because the received parity no longer matches.",
        "Signed numbers: Sign-magnitude (MSB = sign, rest = magnitude) is intuitive but has two representations of zero and complicates arithmetic. 1's complement (flip all bits) also has two zeros. 2's complement (flip all bits, add 1) has a single zero and lets subtraction be done as addition — this is what real hardware uses.",
        "2's complement addition/subtraction: to subtract B from A, add A to the 2's complement of B and discard any final carry-out beyond the register width; a sign mismatch in the result that doesn't match the operand signs signals overflow.",

Floating-point (IEEE-754 style): a sign bit, an exponent field, and a mantissa (significand) field — trades a bit of speed/complexity for a vastly larger dynamic range.",

        whyItMatters:
          "Differentiating Moore and Mealy machines (and drawing their state diagrams) and comparing the two ADC/DAC types are the most frequently asked theory questions in this module — both are conceptual rather than numerical, so precise, example-backed definitions score well.",

        "A state machine models sequential behaviour as a finite set of states with transitions between them triggered by inputs — visualized with a state transition diagram (circles for states, labelled arrows for transitions).",
        "Moore Machine: the output depends only on the current state (not on the current input directly) — output is associated with the state itself, so it changes only on a state transition (clock edge).",
        "Mealy Machine: the output depends on BOTH the current state and the current input — output can change immediately when the input changes, even between clock edges, which generally needs fewer states than an equivalent Moore machine but is more sensitive to input glitches.",
        "DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), Weighted Resistor type: each input bit switches a resistor whose value is weighted by its bit's significance (binary-weighted), summed by an op-amp — simple concept but needs a very wide range of precise resistor values for many bits.",
        "DAC, R-2R Ladder type: uses only two resistor values (R and 2R) repeated in a ladder network, avoiding the wide resistor-value-range problem of the weighted-resistor design — the standard practical DAC architecture.",
        "ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), Flash type: compares the input simultaneously against 2ⁿ−1 reference voltages using that many comparators in parallel — extremely fast (single clock cycle) but needs exponentially more hardware as resolution (bits) increases.",
        "ADC, Successive Approximation type: uses a single comparator plus an internal DAC and a binary search strategy — guesses the MSB first, checks against the input, then refines bit by bit — needs n clock cycles for n bits, far less hardware than flash but slower.",
        "Programmable Logic Devices: PAL (Programmable AND array, fixed OR array) and PLA (both AND and OR arrays programmable) implement custom SOP logic without designing discrete gates; FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is far more flexible, built from a large array of configurable logic blocks and programmable interconnects, capable of implementing entire digital systems, not just combinational SOP logic.",
