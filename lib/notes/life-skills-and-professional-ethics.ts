          "This module covers professional responsibilities (collegiality, loyalty, conflict management, confidentiality, conflicts of interest), employee/professional rights (including IPR and discrimination), and global ethical issues — business, computer, and environmental ethics — including the engineer's role as manager, consultant, or expert witness.",
        whyItMatters:
          "'Conflicts of interest' and 'confidentiality's role in moral integrity' are the two concepts most likely to be asked directly, since they're the ones with the clearest real-world professional consequences — be ready with a concrete workplace example for each.",
      },
      coreConcepts: [
        "Collegiality and loyalty: maintaining respectful, cooperative relationships with colleagues and a reasonable commitment to one's organization/profession, balanced against not compromising ethical principles purely to maintain that loyalty.",
        "Managing conflict and respect for authority: resolving workplace disagreements constructively while still respecting legitimate organizational hierarchy and decision-making authority — though authority does not override ethical obligations (e.g. safety).",
        "Collective bargaining: the process by which employees (often via a union) negotiate collectively with employers over wages, conditions, and rights, rather than individually.",
        "Confidentiality and its role in moral integrity: protecting sensitive information (client, employer, or proprietary data) that one has access to in a professional capacity — breaching confidentiality is treated as both an ethical and often legal failure, since trust is foundational to professional relationships.",
        "Conflicts of interest: situations where a professional's personal interests (financial, relational) could improperly influence their professional judgment or duties — professionals are expected to disclose and avoid acting on such conflicts.",
        "Occupational crime: illegal acts committed in the course of one's job (e.g. fraud, embezzlement, falsifying data) — distinct from personal crime, since it specifically abuses professional position/access.",
        "Professional rights and employee rights: the right to exercise professional judgment, to refuse unethical/unsafe directives, to fair compensation, and protection from discrimination; Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protect an individual's or organization's inventions, designs, and original work from unauthorized use.",
        "Global ethical issues span: Business ethics (fair dealing, honest marketing, anti-corruption), Computer ethics (data privacy, responsible use of technology, cybersecurity responsibility), and Environmental ethics (sustainable practices, minimizing harm to ecosystems) — all increasingly central to engineering's broader societal role.",
        "Engineers take on varied professional roles beyond pure technical work: as Managers (balancing technical and organizational/people responsibilities), Consulting Engineers (providing independent expert advice to clients), and Expert Witnesses/Advisors (providing technical testimony or guidance in legal/regulatory contexts) — each role carries its own specific ethical obligations around independence and honesty.",

      revisionNotes: [
        "Confidentiality = trust foundation; breach = ethical AND often legal failure.",
        "Conflict of interest = personal interest vs professional duty — must disclose & avoid.",
        "Occupational crime = crime committed via abuse of one's job/position.",
        "IPR protects inventions/designs/original work from unauthorized use.",
        "Global ethics = Business + Computer + Environmental ethics.",
        "Engineer roles (manager / consultant / expert witness) each carry distinct ethical duties around independence & honesty.",
      ],
      intuition:
        "A conflict of interest isn't the same as actual wrongdoing — it's a SITUATION where your judgment COULD be compromised, even if you'd never actually act on it. That's exactly why the rule is 'disclose it' rather than 'only act on it if you'd cheat' — the appearance of bias damages trust just as much as real bias would.",
      comparisons: [
        {
          title: "Confidentiality Breach vs Occupational Crime",
          scenario: "Both involve a professional misusing their position — but they're not the same severity or category of violation.",
          a: { label: "Confidentiality breach", body: "Disclosing sensitive information you had legitimate access to. Primarily an ethical failure, though it can carry legal consequences too." },
          b: { label: "Occupational crime", body: "An outright illegal act (fraud, embezzlement, falsifying data) committed by abusing your job position. Always a legal violation, not just an ethical lapse." },
          takeaway: "Every occupational crime is a serious ethical failure, but not every ethical failure (like a careless confidentiality slip) rises to the level of a crime.",
        },
      ],
      selfCheck: [
        { question: "An engineer is asked to review a project proposal submitted by a company owned by their spouse. What should they do, and why?", answer: "Disclose the conflict of interest immediately and recuse themselves from the review, rather than simply trying to be 'extra fair'. The expectation is to avoid even the appearance of compromised judgment, not just to privately ensure good intentions." },
        { question: "Why are business ethics, computer ethics, and environmental ethics grouped together as 'global ethical issues' for engineers specifically?", answer: "Modern engineering work routinely touches all three — commercial dealings (business ethics), data/technology use (computer ethics), and environmental impact (environmental ethics) — making them recurring, society-wide concerns relevant to almost any engineering role, not niche specialist topics." },
