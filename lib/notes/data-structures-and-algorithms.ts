      title: "Hashing Table and Tries",
      overview: {
        summary:
          "This chapter covers the Map ADT and its most common implementation, the hash table: how hash functions are designed, how collisions are resolved (chaining and open addressing), and a brief look at tries for prefix-based string storage.",
        whyItMatters:
          "Designing a hash function for a given key set and resolving collisions by hand (chaining or linear/quadratic probing) is a guaranteed numerical question. The definitions of load factor, the three probing techniques, and trie basics are also frequently asked as short-answer questions.",
      },
      coreConcepts: [
        "Map ADT: stores key-value pairs and supports operations like put(key, value), get(key), and remove(key).",
        "A Hash Table implements the Map ADT using an array plus a hash function that converts a key into an array index, giving O(1) average-case access.",
        "Hash function design — Division method: h(k) = k mod m. Multiplication method: uses the fractional part of k times a constant. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly and is fast to compute.",
        "Load factor α = n/m (number of entries ÷ table size) — directly affects performance; a higher load factor means more collisions and slower operations.",
        "Collision: when two different keys hash to the same slot.",
        "Chaining: each table slot holds a linked list (or similar structure) of all entries that hashed there — simple, but performance degrades as chains grow long.",
        "Open Addressing: on collision, probe for the next available slot within the table itself (no extra structure) — Linear Probing: h'(k,i) = (h(k)+i) mod m (suffers from clustering); Quadratic Probing: h'(k,i) = (h(k)+c₁i+c₂i²) mod m (reduces clustering); Double Hashing: h'(k,i) = (h₁(k)+i·h₂(k)) mod m (uses a second hash function for the step size, best collision spread).",
        "Applications of Hashing: finding duplicates in a list (insert into a hash set, O(1) lookup catches repeats), set intersection (hash one set, then probe with the other for O(n+m) intersection instead of O(n·m)).",
        "Trie (prefix tree): a tree where each path from the root spells out a string, with each edge labelled by a character — used to implement the Map ADT efficiently for string keys, especially for prefix search/autocomplete.",
      ],
      definitions: [
        { term: "Map ADT", definition: "An abstract data type that stores a collection of key-value pairs and supports insertion, lookup, and deletion by key, with each key appearing at most once." },
        { term: "Hash Function", definition: "A function that converts a key into an array index (hash value) for use in a hash table, ideally distributing keys uniformly across the available slots." },
        { term: "Load Factor (α)", definition: "The ratio of the number of stored entries (n) to the total number of slots (m) in a hash table: α = n/m, used as a measure of how full the table is." },
        { term: "Collision", definition: "An event where two distinct keys are mapped by the hash function to the same slot in a hash table." },
        { term: "Chaining", definition: "A collision-resolution technique where each hash table slot holds a linked list of all entries that hashed to that slot." },
        { term: "Open Addressing", definition: "A collision-resolution technique where, on collision, the algorithm probes for another empty slot within the same table according to a fixed probing sequence." },
        { term: "Double Hashing", definition: "An open-addressing technique that uses a second hash function to determine the probe step size, h'(k,i) = (h₁(k) + i·h₂(k)) mod m, giving better key distribution than linear or quadratic probing." },
        { term: "Trie", definition: "A tree-based data structure used to store strings, where each path from the root to a node represents a prefix, enabling fast prefix search and retrieval." },
